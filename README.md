# Hi there, I'm Pedro Nogueira!

## I'm a Computer Engineer graduate from [University of Brasília][UnB]

- Currently going after my master's degree!
- I passed Caixa's exam for a low level job there, but I'm still waiting to be called (April, hopefully o.o)  
- My internships, specially my last one, made me full stack, so yeah.... yuck  
- Recruitment tests are all gonna be here  
- I feel like I won't ever be able to do my passion projects, specially with this master's now =) but let's see, because I feel like I was up to something learning Unity's DOTS, I don't know...
