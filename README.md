# Hi there, I'm Pedro Nogueira!

## I'm a Computer Engineer graduate from [University of Brasília][UnB]

- Currently going after my master's degree! I'm researching the robotic mission development capabilities of [HMRSim, an abstract simulator](https://bdm.unb.br/bitstream/10483/31194/1/2021_GiovanniGuidini_CristianeCardoso_tcc.pdf).
- I'll soon be called to a government job, finally big boi shoes
- I'll try to keep my fullstack skills hot, but man, I just found out that [Unity](https://unity.com/) can run [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) officially, so I'm dying to go back to game dev =B
