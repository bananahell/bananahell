# Hi there, I'm Pedro Nogueira!

## I'm a Computer Engineering Student at [University of Brasília][UnB]

- I am 1 year from graduating from my course!  
- I’m currently learning electronics and low level basic software, along with SDL2 and opencv.  
- I'm actually looking for an internship/job... I have to get some return ¬_¬  
- My personal projects are obviously haulted because of uni, but I'm going through with my idj and ipi projects revival!  
- Public email: cmcg89034@gmail.com  
- Fun fact: I REALLY thought I wouldn't like anything else in my course besides programming (electronics, I love you s2 -- kinda...)  
- Personal interests: Artificial intelligence, gaming and game development, well-typed programming languages and rock 'n' roll!
