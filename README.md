# Hi there, I'm Pedro Nogueira!

## I'm a Computer Engineering Student at [University of Brasilia][UnB]

- I am 2 years from graduating from my course!  
- I’m currently learning computer architecture and Rust.  
- I’m looking to collaborate on personal projects, but only after I graduate...  
- Public email: cmcg89034@gmail.com  
- Fun fact: I REALLY thought I wouldn't like anything else in my course besides programming (electronics, I love you s2)  
- Personal interests: Artificial intelligence, gaming and game development, well-typed programming languages and rock 'n' roll!
